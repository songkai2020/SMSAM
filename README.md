## Segmentation-based Multi-scale attention model for KRAS mutation prediction in rectal cancer
## 1.Introduction
We propose a Segmentation-based Multi-scale attention model(SMSAM) to predict the mutation status of KRAS gene in rectal cancer patients with limited t2-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. This is repository of Segmentation-based Multi-scale attention model.
